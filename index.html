            <h2>Why Lisbon?</h2>
            <h3>Lisbon, City of seven hills</h3>
            <p>
              The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans,
              for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon
              began its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills.
              However, it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey
              Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das
              sete colinas' - the city of seven hills. You can still see traces
              of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array of shops with
              international brands, peaceful streetside cafes selling the iconic
              pastel de nata and world class restaurants with a variety of
              global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills and see the
              city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops, the
              whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue sea.
